# Introduction

Calls for a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) by graduate students across the University of California (UC) system have mobilized activist movements and garnered significant media attention over the course of recent weeks. We present a whitepaper that summarizes the local economic context for these demands, a simple analysis for the cost of implementing a COLA, highlighting the variability in compensation between different graduate programs and disciplines. In this accompanying web app, the source data for the whitepaper is available to explore interactively. We hope that this information is useful to the relevant stakeholders, and encourages the further release of similar information in future.
